This is an extracted form of the [Sword](https://www.crosswire.org/sword) bindings.

If you are building Sword from source, you can just define `-DSWORD_PYTHON_3:BOOL=TRUE` to your CMake bindings
and build this library directly from there. If you want to pull this package directly into a set of Python
dependencies, then you can point here. I will try my best to maintain keeping this up-to-date.
